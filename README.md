This repository is a sample of my various projects from my Computer Science classes. I have been coding since my introduction courses in 
August 2018, so not too long at this point.  I am only selecting those works that I feel highlight my abilities with various languages
while also minimizes my contribution to cheating at my Alma Mater, as I know professors reuse project assignments semester to semester.

The following is an outline of this repo:

Assembly - The projects in this folder are for a Computer Organization and Design class, which mainly focused on Assembly programming.

  -Project 1 - A small project in the C language that manipulates values on the bit level.

  -Project 2 - The fist Assembly project, coded in IA32 assembly language, to perform some basic calculations.

  -Project 3 - This Assembly project simulates accessing memory cache.

FileSystem - This project is a C based simulation of a Single Directory file system using a professor-provided softwaredisk simulator. It
  was done via pair programming with my partner.

Musicality Sample Database - This was a group project to design and set up a basic database.  I was heavily involved in the design and 
  reporting aspect of the database.

Scheme Interpreter in Python - We were given a subset of the Scheme language to write an interpreter in the Python language.  Before this 
  class, I had zero knowledge of both Scheme and Python.  This was also a pair programming project done with my partner, who had the same
  amount of experience in Scheme and Python as I did.
