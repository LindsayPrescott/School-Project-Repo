This is a project to implement an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language in Python.  
The professor provided the binaries for the scanner and parser and we built the interpreter on top of that. 

We used the assignment PDF, in-class hints, and language specficications/documentiation to complete
this project.

Our Closure is not fully functional, but we were able to successfully test most other functionality using
Dr. Baumgartner's provided binary for Closure.

Our group members are Lindsay Prescott and Shannon Conway.
